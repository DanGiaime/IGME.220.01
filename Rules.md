### What is Hexstrat?
Hexstrat is a 2-player turn-based strategy combat game. Players start with their Headquarters at opposite ends of the 3x3x3 hexagonal map, and work their way across the hidden midfield--revealing tiles as they go--in order to capture their opponent's Headquarters, or defeat all of their opponent's units.

### Game Pieces
#### Units
* **12** Infantry units, 6 per player
* **12** Rocketeer units, 6 per player
* **8** Mech units, 4 per player
#### Tiles
The game has 37 total tiles:
* **2** Headquarters tiles, one per player
* **35** Land tiles
  * **15** Plains tiles
  * **10** Mountain tiles
  * **10** Forest tiles

### Win Conditions
* Rout - Defeat all of your opponent's units in combat.
* Seize - Capture your opponent's Headquarters.

### Setup
* Begin by selecting the two Headquarters tiles(bright green), and placing them exactly 3 tiles-length apart.
* Place all world tiles onto the field randomly upside-down, so that the logo is not visible.
  * Begin by placing the 3 upside-down tiles between the two Headquarters. Then, build outwards equally on both sides until all tiles have been placed, and a hexagon shape is achieved. The Headquarters should be at opposing corners of the hexagonal map.
* Place all squads onto the Headquarters tile.
  * Starting squads
      * Infantry - 6 units
      * Rocketeer - 6 units
      * Mech - 4 units
  * Squad sizes
      * Infantry - 6 units
      * Rocketeer - 6 units
      * Mech - 4 units
  * A squad moves as one.
      * All units in a given squad MUST move at the same time, to the same location.
      * A squad cannot split into partial groups of units.
      * If some units are destroyed, the rest of the squad must continue to move as one.
* Deciding who goes first
  * Play a round of _Rock, Paper, Scissors_. The winning player goes first.

### Tiles

Tiles may only have one squad on them at any time. Some tiles have attack or defense  bonuses. Tiles may also impede or prevent movement for some units.

 | Tile     | Battle Effect                           | Discovery/Movement Effects                                 |
 | :------- | :-------------------------------------- | :----------------                                 |
 |  Plains  |  No Effect                              | No Effect                                         |
 |  Forest  | +1 Defense to squad as a whole          | Mechs are __impeded__ for the next turn |
 | Mountains| +1 Attack +1 Defense to squad as a whole| Mechs can not move onto mountains |
 | Headquarters     |  No squad Limit on turn 1                | If opponent Headquarters, squad is __impeded__                    |


### Movement/Exploration
* _Tiles_ are placed upside-down across the field, so that the type of tile is hidden (i.e. you cannot see if a tile is mountain, forest, or plains).
* Tile Reveal happens when you move a squad into “unknown terrain” i.e. move them into fog of war
* Tile Reveal consists of flipping a Tile that was previously unknown terrain.
* One must first declare their intent to move a squad in a given direction, at which point the unknown Terrain Tile is flipped at that location. If the squad can move onto the new tile, it does so. If not, the squad does not move onto the tile, and can not move again during this turn.
* Each squad can only move one tile per turn.
* __Impeded__ - Some actions may cause a squad to become impeded. After becoming impeded, the only action that squad may take is to resolve its impeded state. While impeded, the squad still retaliates if attacked.

### Tile Bonuses

Some tiles offer a Tile Bonus to the first player to move on to that tile. Immediately upon moving onto a tile that offers a Tile Bonus, draw a card from the Tile Bonus Card Deck to your hand. You do not have to show the card to the opponent until you play it. Unless otherwise specified, you may play a Tile Bonus Card on any of your turns. You may only use one Tile Bonus Card per turn.

Though the cards themselves specify their effects, another reference is provided here:

| Bonus | Effect |
| :---- | :----- |
| Survivors Found | You discovered some survivors! **+2 Infantry/Rockets OR +1 Mech.** *Apply this effect immediately.* |
| Artillery Strike | You strike from a distance. **Pick any enemy squad to take one health away from.** |
| Extra Ammo | **Once during combat, you may attack twice.** |
| Boost (aka *Haul Ass*) | **Move one squad twice in one turn.** |
| Scout | You deploy a scouting mission. **Reveal two adjacent tiles of your choice.** |

### Turn Actions
* Each squad gets one action
* An action consists of either a move, an attack, or resetting that unit's _impeded_ state.
* Squads can also choose not to perform any action on their turn.
* Players may play one Tile Bonus Card.
* Once all of a player's squads have expended their actions, or chosen not to perform any actions, the turn is over.

### Combat

Combat occurs when a player's unit attempts to move onto a tile owned by another player, or a player declares an attack on an adjacent enemy unit. Combat can be declared regardless of movement capability.

Squads have 3 stats used in battle - __HP__, __DEF__, and __ATK__.

###### HP

A squad's HP is equal to the number of units in the squad. During battle, a squad can only attack if it has at least one HP. If a squad is killed before it can attack, it will deal no damage. When a squad loses HP, units are removed from that squad equal to the amount of damage taken.

###### DEF

All squads default to 0 DEF, and can only gain DEF via Tile/Card Bonuses. When a squad would take any amount of damage, it will first subtract its DEF from this damage before taking it. For example, if a squad were to take 3 damage, but the squad has 1 DEF, the squad will take 3 - 1 = 2 damage instead.

###### ATK

ATK is determined based on which unit-type attacks which unit type. The number of units in a squad has no effect on damage dealt.
Each unit type has a specific ATK value depending on the unit type it is attacking:


| Infantry   | Value  |
| :--------- | :----- |
| vs. Infantry | 1 ATK |
| vs. Rocketeer | 3 ATK |
| vs. Mech   | 2 ATK |


| Rocketeer | Value  |
| :--------- | :----- |
| vs. Rocketeer  | 1 ATK |
| vs. Mech | 3 ATK |
| vs. Infantry | 2 ATK |


|  Mech  | Value  |
| :--------- | :----- |
| vs. Mech | 1 ATK |
| vs. Infantry | 4 ATK |
| vs. Rocketeer  | 2 ATK |


Combat happens in two stages:

1. The attacking squad adds its attack value to the _tiles_ bonus values and deals that much damage to the defending squad.
2. The defending squad, __if still alive__, adds its attack value to the _tiles_ bonus and deals that much damage to the attacking squad.

For example, if a squad of 4 mechs attack a squad of 2 infantry, and both do not have any tile modifiers:

1. 4 ATK = 4 defending infantry lost
2. 2 ATK = 2 attacking mech lost

If a squad of 2 mechs attack a squad of 4 infantry, and the infantry are on the mountains:

1. 4 ATK - 1 DEF = 3 defending infantry lost
2. 2 ATK + 1 ATK = 3 attacking mech lost

### Capturing your opponent's HQ

To capture your opponent's Headquarters, your __infantry__ must occupy their Headquarters tile for 3 consecutive turns (including the turn they move onto the tile). On the third turn, the Headquarters is captured, and you win!

The attacking player starts the counter on the turn they enter the enemy's HQ. On the attacking player's next turn, if the attacking player's infantry remain on the HQ, the count goes to 2. On the attacking player's next turn after that, if the attacking player's infantry remain on the HQ, the counter goes to 3 and the attacking player wins.
