 * When this Unit is on a given tile, it experiences the following effect


 | Tile     | Effect                                  |
 | :------- | :-------------------------------------- |
 |  Plains  |  No Effect                              |

 | Mountains| +1 Attack +1 Defense to squad as a whole|


### Tile Placement
* _Tiles_ are stored in a stack, upside-down so that the type of tile is hidden (i.e. you cannot see if a tile is mountain, forest, or plains).
* Tile Placement happens when you move a unit into “unknown terrain” i.e. move them into fog of war
* Tile placement consists of grabbing a Tile from the Tile Stack
* Tile stack, and placing it where one intends to move. One must first declare their intent to move in a given direction, at which point a Terrain Tile is drawn and placed at that location. If the moving Unit can move onto the new tile, it does so. If not, the Unit goes into a Stunned state for a turn, and does not move.
* A given Unit can reveal at most one tile per turn.

### Turn Order
1. Move Unit(s) (if not impeded)
2. Reveal Tile (If Unit in fog)
3. Attack (if there is another Unit on the Tile being moved to)

### Battle
* Battle occurs when one Unit declares an attack on an adjacent Unit owned by the other player.
