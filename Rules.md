### Setup
* Begin by selecting the two Headquarters tiles(bright green), and placing them exactly 3 tiles-length apart.
* Place all world tiles onto the field randomly upside-down, so that the logo is not visible.
  * Begin by placing the 3 upside-down tiles between the two Headquarters. Then, build outwards equally on both sides until all tiles have been placed, and a hexagon shape is achieved. The Headquarters should be at opposing corners of the hexagonal map.
* Place all units onto the Headquarters tile.
  * Starting Units
    * Infantry - 10
    * Mech - 3

* Tile Effects
 * When this Unit is on a given tile, it experiences the following effect


 | Tile     | Effect                                  |
 | :------- | :-------------------------------------- |
 |  Plains  |  No Effect                              |
 |  Forest  | +1 Defense to squad as a whole          |
 | Mountains| +1 Attack +1 Defense to squad as a whole|


### Tile Placement
* _Tiles_ are stored in a stack, upside-down so that the type of tile is hidden (i.e. you cannot see if a tile is mountain, forest, or plains).
* Tile Placement happens when you move a unit into “unknown terrain” i.e. move them into fog of war
* Tile placement consists of grabbing a Tile from the Tile Stack
* Tile stack, and placing it where one intends to move. One must first declare their intent to move in a given direction, at which point a Terrain Tile is drawn and placed at that location. If the moving Unit can move onto the new tile, it does so. If not, the Unit goes into a Stunned state for a turn, and does not move.
* A given Unit can reveal at most one tile per turn.

### Turn Order
1. Move Unit(s) (if not impeded)
2. Reveal Tile (If Unit in fog)
3. Attack (if there is another Unit on the Tile being moved to)

### Battle
* Battle occurs when one Unit declares an attack on an adjacent Unit owned by the other player.
