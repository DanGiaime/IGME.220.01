* The card in the beginning (mountain with a star) changed up the early game strategy well
* We need to write on each card what is an instant card and which is not
* Keep the cards private when you pick them up (keep them face down in front of you)
* We need the diagram drawn out for the combat table
* We want to be able to use the abilities right away
* Be explicit that when you discover a tile, then it cannot be discovered again
* We have to ship with extra people
* Thematically for the Survivors found can be defectors
* The survivors really worked with changing the tide of battle
* They actually wanted to find them
* Both of the artillery strike worked very well

Playing with these bonuses again:
| Bonus | Effect   |   Count |
|---|---|---|
| Extra Ammo  | Hold onto this card, when you decide to use it during combat, then you can attack twice |  2 |

| Boost (aka Haul Ass)  | Move twice with the unit that discovered this bonus|  2 |

* We need to add the limitations on the head quarters to the rules
* The combat is pretty well balanced
* 8 total cards and 6 locations on the map
* Want more bonuses
* We want more cards to actually draw from, in order to add more variance
* Noah got a lot of cards right at the beginning on f the game, maybe add something where you can only place them in the mid field
* Flare up in the sky to reveal tiles adjacent to you
